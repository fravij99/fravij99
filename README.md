# Introducing myself:
I'm a master physics student. I got my bachelor's degree in physics in 2022 in Milan. I am interested in Machine and Deep learning problems. 

My bachelor's thesis deal with the electromagnetic caracterization of a telescope MHFT prototype for the LiteBird satellite space-mission 🛰️.

Now I'm currently focusing on my master thesis, reported on airport_forecasting folder. It's about now-casting meterological previsions by conv-LSTM neural network architecture fore areonautical applications 🛩️.

I'm 23 and I like coding, playing volleyball and enjoying nature 🌳.
